O_DIRECT

(since Linux 2.4.10) Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O
to and from this file. In general this will degrade performance, but it
is useful in special situations, such as when applications do their own
caching. File I/O is done directly to/from user-space buffers. The
O_DIRECT flag on its own makes an effort to transfer data synchronously,
but does not give the guarantees of the O_SYNC flag that data and
necessary metadata are transferred. To guarantee synchronous I/O, O_SYNC
must be used in addition to O_DIRECT. See NOTES below for further
discussion.

A semantically similar (but deprecated) interface for block devices is
described in raw(8).
