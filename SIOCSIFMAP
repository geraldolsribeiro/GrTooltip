SIOCSIFMAP

Set the interface's hardware parameters using ifr_map. Setting the parameters
is a privileged operation.

struct ifmap {
  unsigned long  mem_start;
  unsigned long  mem_end;
  unsigned short base_addr;
  unsigned char  irq;
  unsigned char  dma;
  unsigned char  port;
};

The interpretation of the ifmap structure depends on the device driver
and the architecture.
