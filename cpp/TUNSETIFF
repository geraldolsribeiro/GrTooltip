TUNSETIFF

The queue were enabled by default after it was created through TUNSETIFF.

From version 3.8, Linux supports multiqueue tuntap which can uses multiple file
descriptors (queues) to parallelize packets sending or receiving.

The device allocation is the same as before, and if user wants to create
multiple queues, TUNSETIFF with the same device name must be called many times
with IFF_MULTI_QUEUE flag.
