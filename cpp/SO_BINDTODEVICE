SO_BINDTODEVICE

Bind this socket to a particular device like “eth0”, as
specified in the passed interface name. If the name is an empty string
or the option length is zero, the socket device binding is removed. The
passed option is a variable-length null-terminated interface name string
with the maximum size of IFNAM‐ SIZ. If a socket is bound to an
interface, only packets received from that particular interface are
processed by the socket. Note that this works only for some socket
types, particularly AF_INET sockets. It is not supported for packet
sockets (use normal bind(2) there).

Before Linux 3.8, this socket option could be set, but could not
retrieved with getsockopt(2). Since Linux 3.8, it is readable. The
optlen argument should contain the buffer size available to receive the
device name and is recommended to be IFNAMSIZ bytes. The real device
name length is reported back in the optlen argument.
