EAI_SERVICE

The requested service is not available for the requested
socket type. It may be available through another socket type. For
example, this error could oc‐ cur if service was "shell" (a service
available only on stream sockets), and either hints.ai_protocol was
IPPROTO_UDP, or hints.ai_socktype was SOCK_DGRAM; or the error could
occur if service was not NULL, and hints.ai_socktype was SOCK_RAW (a
socket type that does not support the concept of ser‐ vices).
