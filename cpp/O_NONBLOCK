O_NONBLOCK

or O_NDELAY When possible, the file is opened in nonblocking
mode. Neither the open() nor any subsequent I/O operations on the file
descriptor which is returned will cause the calling process to wait.

Note that the setting of this flag has no effect on the operation of
poll(2), select(2), epoll(7), and similar, since those interfaces merely
inform the caller about whether a file descriptor is "ready", meaning
that an I/O operation performed on the file descriptor with the
O_NONBLOCK flag clear would not block.

Note that this flag has no effect for regular files and block devices;
that is, I/O operations will (briefly) block when device activity is
required, re‚Äê gardless of whether O_NONBLOCK is set. Since O_NONBLOCK
semantics might eventually be implemented, applications should not
depend upon blocking behavior when specifying this flag for regular
files and block devices.

For the handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also fifo(7). For a
discussion of the effect of O_NONBLOCK in conjunction with mandatory
file locks and with file leases, see fcntl(2).
