SO_BSDCOMPAT

Enable BSD bug-to-bug compatibility. This is used by the
UDP protocol module in Linux 2.0 and 2.2. If enabled, ICMP errors
received for a UDP socket will not be passed to the user program. In
later kernel versions, support for this option has been phased out:
Linux 2.4 silently ignores it, and Linux 2.6 generates a kernel warning
(printk()) if a program uses this option. Linux 2.0 also enabled BSD
bug-to-bug compatibility options (random header changing, skipping of
the broadcast flag) for raw sockets with this option, but that was
removed in Linux 2.2.
