O_DSYNC

Write operations on the file will complete according to the
requirements of synchronized I/O data integrity completion.

By the time write(2) (and similar) return, the output data has been
transferred to the underlying hardware, along with any file metadata
that would be re‚Äê quired to retrieve that data (i.e., as though each
write(2) was followed by a call to fdatasync(2)). See NOTES below.
