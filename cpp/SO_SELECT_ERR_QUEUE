SO_SELECT_ERR_QUEUE

(since Linux 3.10) When this option is set on a
socket, an error condition on a socket causes notification not only via
the exceptfds set of select(2). Similarly, poll(2) also returns a
POLLPRI whenever an POLLERR event is returned.

Background: this option was added when waking up on an error condition
occurred only via the readfds and writefds sets of select(2). The option
was added to allow monitoring for error conditions via the exceptfds
argument without simultaneously having to receive notifications (via
readfds) for regular data that can be read from the socket. After
changes in Linux 4.16, the use of this flag to achieve the desired
notifications is no longer necessary. This option is nevertheless
retained for backwards compatibility.
