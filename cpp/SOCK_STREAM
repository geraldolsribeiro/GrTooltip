SOCK_STREAM

Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams.
An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be supported.

The communications protocols which implement a SOCK_STREAM ensure that
data is not lost or duplicated.  If a piece of data for which the peer
protocol has buffer space  cannot  be successfully transmitted within
a reasonable length of time, then the connection is considered to be
dead.
