IFF_NO_PI

This commit adds flag IFF_NO_PI to tun/tap interface settings on Linux. It
changes frame format in order not to include protocol information header. That
is, with this flag, frames received/send from tun/tap fd consist solely of raw
underlying protocol (Ethernet/IP) frames.

Protocol information header is not used by the element in any way, but its
presence adds a requirement for pulling packet data on receive and pushing it
before writing packet to the fd. Such a push becomes an expensive push when
there is is no enough headroom in packet, for example when using native netmap
buffers, which do not have any headroom.

Adding IFF_NO_PI flag eliminates the need for pulling and pushing packet data
completely.

Moreover, this commit removes support for LINUX_ETHERTAP mode. Ethertap driver
was removed from the kernel more than 15 years ago. Removal of this mode
significantly simplifies the logic within the element.
