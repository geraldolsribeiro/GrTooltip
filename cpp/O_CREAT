O_CREAT

If pathname does not exist, create it as a regular file.

The owner (user ID) of the new file is set to the effective user ID of
the process.

The group ownership (group ID) of the new file is set either to the
effective group ID of the process (System V semantics) or to the group
ID of the par‐ ent directory (BSD semantics). On Linux, the behavior
depends on whether the set-group-ID mode bit is set on the parent
directory: if that bit is set, then BSD semantics apply; otherwise,
System V semantics apply. For some filesystems, the behavior also
depends on the bsdgroups and sysvgroups mount op‐ tions described in
mount(8).

The mode argument specifies the file mode bits to be applied when a new
file is created. If neither O_CREAT nor O_TMPFILE is specified in flags,
then mode is ignored (and can thus be specified as 0, or simply
omitted). The mode argument must be supplied if O_CREAT or O_TMPFILE is
specified in flags; if it is not supplied, some arbitrary bytes from the
stack will be applied as the file mode.

The effective mode is modified by the process's umask in the usual way:
in the absence of a default ACL, the mode of the created file is (mode &
~umask).

Note that mode applies only to future accesses of the newly created
file; the open() call that creates a read-only file may well return a
read/write file descriptor.

The following symbolic constants are provided for mode:
