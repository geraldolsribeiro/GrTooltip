sockaddr_storage

The sockaddr_storage structure is a sockaddr that is not associated with an
address family.  Instead, it is large enough to hold the contents of any of the
other sockaddr structures.  It can be used to embed sufficient storage for
a sockaddr of any type within a larger structure.

The structure only has a single member defined.  While there are other members
that are used to pad out the size of the struct sockaddr_storage, they are not
defined and must not be consumed.  The only valid member is:

sa_family_t     ss_family       /* address family */
