O_TRUNC

If the file already exists and is a regular file and the access
mode allows writing (i.e., is O_RDWR or O_WRONLY) it will be truncated
to length 0. If the file is a FIFO or terminal device file, the O_TRUNC
flag is ignored. Otherwise, the effect of O_TRUNC is unspecified.

creat() A call to creat() is equivalent to calling open() with flags
equal to O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.

openat() The openat() system call operates in exactly the same way as
open(), except for the differences described here.

If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted
relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor dirfd
(rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling
process, as is done by open() for a relative pathname).

If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then
pathname is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the
calling process (like open()).

If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

openat2(2) The openat2(2) system call is an extension of openat(), and
provides a superset of the features of openat(). It is documented
separately, in openat2(2).
