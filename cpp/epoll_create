`epoll_create`

The epoll instance is created by means of the `epoll_create` system call, which
returns a file descriptor to the epoll instance. The signature of `epoll_create`
is as follows:

    #include <sys/epoll.h>
    int epoll_create(int size);

The size argument is an indication to the kernel about the number of file
descriptors a process wants to monitor, which helps the kernel to decide the
size of the epoll instance. Since Linux 2.6.8, this argument is ignored because
the epoll data structure dynamically resizes as file descriptors are added or
removed from it.

The `epoll_create` system call returns a file descriptor to the newly created
epoll kernel data structure. The calling process can then use this file
descriptor to add, remove or modify other file descriptors it wants to monitor
for I/O to the epoll instance.
