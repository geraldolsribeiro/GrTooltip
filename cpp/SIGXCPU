SIGXCPU

P2001 Core CPU time limit exceeded (4.2BSD); see setrlimit(2)
SIGXFSZ P2001 Core File size limit exceeded (4.2BSD); see setrlimit(2)
SIGWINCH - Ign Window resize signal (4.3BSD, Sun)

The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

Up to and including Linux 2.2, the default behavior for SIGSYS, SIGXCPU,
SIGXFSZ, and (on architectures other than SPARC and MIPS) SIGBUS was to
terminate the process (without a core dump). (On some other UNIX systems
the default action for SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ is to terminate the process
without a core dump.) Linux 2.4 conforms to the POSIX.1-2001
requirements for these signals, terminating the process with a core
dump.
