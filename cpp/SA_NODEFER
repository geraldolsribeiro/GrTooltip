SA_NODEFER

Do not add the signal to the thread's signal mask while the
handler is executing, unless the signal is specified in act.sa_mask.
Consequently, a further instance of the signal may be delivered to the
thread while it is executing the handler. This flag is meaningful only
when establishing a signal handler.
