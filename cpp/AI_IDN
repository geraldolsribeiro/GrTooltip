AI_IDN

If this flag is specified, then the node name given in node is
converted to IDN format if necessary. The source encoding is that of the
current locale.

If the input name contains non-ASCII characters, then the IDN encoding
is used. Those parts of the node name (delimited by dots) that contain
non-ASCII characters are encoded using ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE)
before being passed to the name resolution functions.
