O_ASYNC

Enable signal-driven I/O: generate a signal (SIGIO by default,
but this can be changed via fcntl(2)) when input or output becomes
possible on this file descriptor. This feature is available only for
terminals, pseudoterminals, sockets, and (since Linux 2.6) pipes and
FIFOs. See fcntl(2) for further de‚Äê tails. See also BUGS, below.
