SA_NOCLDWAIT

(since Linux 2.6) If signum is SIGCHLD, do not transform
children into zombies when they terminate. See also waitpid(2). This
flag is meaningful only when establishing a handler for SIGCHLD, or when
setting that signal's disposition to SIG_DFL.

If the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is set when establishing a handler for SIGCHLD,
POSIX.1 leaves it unspecified whether a SIGCHLD signal is generated when
a child process terminates. On Linux, a SIGCHLD signal is generated in
this case; on some other implementations, it is not.
