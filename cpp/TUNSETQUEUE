TUNSETQUEUE

A new ioctl(TUNSETQUEUE) were introduced to enable or disable a queue. When
calling it with IFF_DETACH_QUEUE flag, the queue were disabled. And when
calling it with IFF_ATTACH_QUEUE flag, the queue were enabled. The queue were
enabled by default after it was created through TUNSETIFF.

fd is the file descriptor (queue) that we want to enable or disable, when
enable is true we enable it, otherwise we disable it

#include <linux/if.h>
#include <linux/if_tun.h>

int tun_set_queue(int fd, int enable)
{
    struct ifreq ifr;

    memset(&ifr, 0, sizeof(ifr));

    if (enable)
       ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_ATTACH_QUEUE;
    else
       ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_DETACH_QUEUE;

    return ioctl(fd, TUNSETQUEUE, (void *)&ifr);
}
