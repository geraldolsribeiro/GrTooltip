AI_CANONIDN

After a successful name lookup, and if the AI_CANONNAME flag
was specified, getaddrinfo() will return the canonical name of the node
corresponding to the addrinfo structure value passed back. The return
value is an exact copy of the value returned by the name resolution
function.

If the name is encoded using ACE, then it will contain the xn-- prefix
for one or more components of the name. To convert these components into
a read‚Äê able form the AI_CANONIDN flag can be passed in addition to
AI_CANONNAME. The resulting string is encoded using the current locale's
encoding.

AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES Setting these flags
will enable the IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED (allow unassigned Unicode code
points) and IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES (check output to make sure it is a
STD3 conforming hostname) flags respectively to be used in the IDNA
handling.
