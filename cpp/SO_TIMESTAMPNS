SO_TIMESTAMPNS

(since Linux 2.6.22) Enable or disable the receiving of
the SO_TIMESTAMPNS control message. The timestamp control message is
sent with level SOL_SOCKET and a cmsg_type of SCM_TIMESTAMPNS. The
cmsg_data field is a struct timespec indicating the reception time of
the last packet passed to the user in this call. The clock used for the
timestamp is CLOCK_REALTIME. See cmsg(3) for details on control
messages.

A socket cannot mix SO_TIMESTAMP and SO_TIMESTAMPNS: the two modes are
mutually exclusive.
