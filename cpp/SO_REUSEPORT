SO_REUSEPORT

(since Linux 3.9) Permits multiple AF_INET or AF_INET6
sockets to be bound to an identical socket address. This option must be
set on each socket (including the first socket) prior to calling bind(2)
on the socket. To prevent port hijacking, all of the processes binding
to the same address must have the same effective UID. This option can be
employed with both TCP and UDP sockets.

For TCP sockets, this option allows accept(2) load distribution in a
multi-threaded server to be improved by using a distinct listener socket
for each thread. This provides improved load distribution as compared to
traditional techniques such using a single accept(2)ing thread that
distributes connec‐ tions, or having multiple threads that compete to
accept(2) from the same socket.

For UDP sockets, the use of this option can provide better distribution
of incoming datagrams to multiple processes (or threads) as compared to
the tradi‐ tional technique of having multiple processes compete to
receive datagrams on the same socket.
