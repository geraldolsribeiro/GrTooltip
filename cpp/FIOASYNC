FIOASYNC

Change the O_ASYNC flag to enable or disable asynchronous I/O
mode of the socket. Asynchronous I/O mode means that the SIGIO signal or
the signal set with F_SETSIG is raised when a new I/O event occurs.

Argument is an integer boolean flag. (This operation is synonymous with
the use of fcntl(2) to set the O_ASYNC flag.)
