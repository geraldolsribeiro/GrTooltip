IFF_RUNNING

IFF_RUNNING is supposed to reflect the operational status on a network
interface, rather than its administrative one. To provide an example, an
Ethernet interface may be brought UP by the administrator (e.g. ifconfig eth0
up), but it will not be considered operational (i.e. RUNNING as per RFC2863) 
if the cable is not plugged in.
