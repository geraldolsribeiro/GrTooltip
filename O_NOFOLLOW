O_NOFOLLOW

If the trailing component (i.e., basename) of pathname is a symbolic link, then
the open fails, with the error ELOOP. Symbolic links in earlier compo‚Äê nents of
the pathname will still be followed. (Note that the ELOOP error that can occur
in this case is indistinguishable from the case where an open fails because
there are too many symbolic links found while resolving components in the
prefix part of the pathname.)

This flag is a FreeBSD extension, which was added to Linux in version
2.1.126, and has subsequently been standardized in POSIX.1-2008.
