SO_RCVLOWAT

and SO_SNDLOWAT Specify the minimum number of bytes in the
buffer until the socket layer will pass the data to the protocol
(SO_SNDLOWAT) or the user on receiving (SO_RCVLOWAT). These two values
are initialized to 1. SO_SNDLOWAT is not changeable on Linux
(setsockopt(2) fails with the error ENOPROTOOPT). SO_RCVLOWAT is
changeable only since Linux 2.4.

Before Linux 2.6.28 select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7) did not respect the
SO_RCVLOWAT setting on Linux, and indicated a socket as readable when
even a sin‚Äê gle byte of data was available. A subsequent read from the
socket would then block until SO_RCVLOWAT bytes are available. Since
Linux 2.6.28, select(2), poll(2), and epoll(7) indicate a socket as
readable only if at least SO_RCVLOWAT bytes are available.
