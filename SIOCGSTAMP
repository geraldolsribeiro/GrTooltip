SIOCGSTAMP

Return a struct timeval with the receive timestamp of the
last packet passed to the user. This is useful for accurate round trip
time measurements. See setitimer(2) for a description of struct timeval.
This ioctl should be used only if the socket options SO_TIMESTAMP and
SO_TIMESTAMPNS are not set on the socket. Otherwise, it returns the
timestamp of the last packet that was received while SO_TIMESTAMP and
SO_TIMESTAMPNS were not set, or it fails if no such packet has been
received, (i.e., ioctl(2) returns -1 with errno set to ENOENT).
