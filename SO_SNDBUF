SO_SNDBUF

Sets or gets the maximum socket send buffer in bytes. The
kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when
it is set using set‐ sockopt(2), and this doubled value is returned by
getsockopt(2). The default value is set by the
/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default file and the maximum al‐ lowed value is
set by the /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max file. The minimum (doubled) value
for this option is 2048.
