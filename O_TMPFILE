O_TMPFILE

(since Linux 3.11) Create an unnamed temporary regular file.
The pathname argument specifies a directory; an unnamed inode will be
created in that directory's filesystem. Anything written to the
resulting file will be lost when the last file descriptor is closed,
unless the file is given a name.
