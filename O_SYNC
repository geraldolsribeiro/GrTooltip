O_SYNC

Write operations on the file will complete according to the
requirements of synchronized I/O file integrity completion (by contrast
with the synchronized I/O data integrity completion provided by
O_DSYNC.)

By the time write(2) (or similar) returns, the output data and
associated file metadata have been transferred to the underlying
hardware (i.e., as though each write(2) was followed by a call to
fsync(2)). See NOTES below.
