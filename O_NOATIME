O_NOATIME

(since Linux 2.6.8) Do not update the file last access time
(st_atime in the inode) when the file is read(2).

This flag can be employed only if one of the following conditions is
true:

* The effective UID of the process matches the owner UID of the file.

* The calling process has the CAP_FOWNER capability in its user
namespace and the owner UID of the file has a mapping in the namespace.

This flag is intended for use by indexing or backup programs, where its
use can significantly reduce the amount of disk activity. This flag may
not be effective on all filesystems. One example is NFS, where the
server maintains the access time.
