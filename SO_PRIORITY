SO_PRIORITY

Set the protocol-defined priority for all packets to be sent
on this socket. Linux uses this value to order the networking queues:
packets with a higher priority may be processed first depending on the
selected device queueing discipline. Setting a priority outside the
range 0 to 6 requires the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
