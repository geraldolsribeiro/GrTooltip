SO_RCVBUF

Sets or gets the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes. The
kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when
it is set using setsockopt(2), and this doubled value is returned by
getsockopt(2). The default value is set by the
/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default file, and the maximum allowed value is
set by the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max file. The minimum (doubled) value
for this option is 256.
