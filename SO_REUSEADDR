SO_REUSEADDR

Indicates that the rules used in validating addresses
supplied in a bind(2) call should allow reuse of local addresses. For
AF_INET sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when there is
an active listening socket bound to the address. When the listening
socket is bound to INADDR_ANY with a specific port then it is not
possible to bind to this port for any local address. Argument is an
integer boolean flag.
