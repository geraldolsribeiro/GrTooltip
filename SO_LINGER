SO_LINGER

Sets or gets the SO_LINGER option. The argument is a linger
structure.

struct linger { int l_onoff; /* linger active */ int l_linger; /* how
many seconds to linger for */ };

When enabled, a close(2) or shutdown(2) will not return until all queued
messages for the socket have been successfully sent or the linger
timeout has been reached. Otherwise, the call returns immediately and
the closing is done in the background. When the socket is closed as part
of exit(2), it always lingers in the background.
