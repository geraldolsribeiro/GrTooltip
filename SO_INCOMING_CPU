SO_INCOMING_CPU

(gettable since Linux 3.19, settable since Linux 4.4)
Sets or gets the CPU affinity of a socket. Expects an integer flag.

int cpu = 1; setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_INCOMING_CPU, &cpu,
sizeof(cpu));

Because all of the packets for a single stream (i.e., all packets for
the same 4-tuple) arrive on the single RX queue that is associated with
a particular CPU, the typical use case is to employ one listening
process per RX queue, with the incoming flow being handled by a listener
on the same CPU that is han‚Äê dling the RX queue. This provides optimal
NUMA behavior and keeps CPU caches hot.
