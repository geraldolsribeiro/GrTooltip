SO_INCOMING_NAPI_ID

(gettable since Linux 4.12) Returns a system-level
unique ID called NAPI ID that is associated with a RX queue on which the
last packet associated with that socket is received.

This can be used by an application to split the incoming flows among
worker threads based on the RX queue on which the packets associated
with the flows are received. It allows each worker thread to be
associated with a NIC HW receive queue and service all the connection
requests received on that RX queue. This mapping between a app thread
and a HW NIC queue streamlines the flow of data from the NIC to the
application.
