SO_RCVTIMEO

and SO_SNDTIMEO Specify the receiving or sending timeouts
until reporting an error. The argument is a struct timeval. If an input
or output function blocks for this pe‐ riod of time, and data has been
sent or received, the return value of that function will be the amount
of data transferred; if no data has been trans‐ ferred and the timeout
has been reached, then -1 is returned with errno set to EAGAIN or
EWOULDBLOCK, or EINPROGRESS (for connect(2)) just as if the socket was
specified to be nonblocking. If the timeout is set to zero (the
default), then the operation will never timeout. Timeouts only have
effect for system calls that perform socket I/O (e.g., read(2),
recvmsg(2), send(2), sendmsg(2)); timeouts have no effect for select(2),
poll(2), epoll_wait(2), and so on.
