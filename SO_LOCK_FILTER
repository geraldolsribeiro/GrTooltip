SO_LOCK_FILTER

When set, this option will prevent changing the filters
associated with the socket. These filters include any set using the
socket options SO_ATTACH_FIL‐ TER, SO_ATTACH_BPF,
SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF, and SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF.

The typical use case is for a privileged process to set up a raw socket
(an operation that requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability), apply a
restrictive fil‐ ter, set the SO_LOCK_FILTER option, and then either
drop its privileges or pass the socket file descriptor to an
unprivileged process via a UNIX domain socket.

Once the SO_LOCK_FILTER option has been enabled, attempts to change or
remove the filter attached to a socket, or to disable the SO_LOCK_FILTER
option will fail with the error EPERM.
